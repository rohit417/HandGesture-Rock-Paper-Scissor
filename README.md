# HandGesture-Rock-Paper-Scissor
A fun retro-style Rock-Paper-Scissors game powered by real-time hand gesture detection using your webcam! Built using OpenCV, CVZone, and MediaPipe, this project lets you play the classic game using only your hand movements — no buttons, no clicks, just ✊ ✋ ✌️ and vibes 😄
